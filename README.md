# Source code and Results of Label-Aware Aggregation for Improved Federated Learning

- **src folder:** contains all classes, with federeted_main.py as a starting point
- **save folder:** contains the full set of experimental results 


# Run the experiments:
- Please check the options.py to check the possible running options
- As an example, "python3 federated_main.py --avg_type=avg_n_classes --number_of_classes_group1_user=2 --noniidness_end_id=1 --frac=0.1" means that the unique_c = 2, noniid_s=0.1, and k_r=0.1
